## LDA Plot 

### Description
##### LDA and plot
Linear discriminant analysis(LDA) is a method used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or event. The idea of LDA is to find a linear combination of variables to model the difference between the classes of a particular set of variable (usually categorical variables). Since LDA and PCA (both finds a linear combination of variables) are similar techniques, LDA can be visualized as well through plotting the variables on dimensions of linear coefficients just as biplot for PCA.
